# Minor-minimal spectator floor of a graph

This code repository was used for the paper "[A combinatorial bound on the number of distinct eigenvalues of a graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11307)" by [Sarah Allred](https://www.sarah-allred.net/), [Craig Erickson](https://cerickson30.github.io/), [Kevin Grace](https://kevingracemath.wordpress.com/), H. Tracy Hall, and [Alathea Jensen](https://www.susqu.edu/live/profiles/263-alathea-jensen), which can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11307).

A parade in a graph is a unique shortest path between two vertices. The parade number of a graph is the maximum number of vertices in a parade, that is, the number of vertices in the longest unique shortest path in the graph. The spectator number of a graph is the number of vertices *not* in the longest unique shortest path.

This project determines the graphs up to (and including) 10 vertices which are minor-minimal with respect to the minor floor of the spectator number.
