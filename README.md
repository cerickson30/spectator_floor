# Minor-minimal spectator floor of a graph

A parade in a graph is a unique shortest path between two vertices. The parade number of a graph is the maximum number of vertices in a parade, that is, the number of vertices in the longest unique shortest path in the graph. The spectator number of a graph is the number of vertices *not* in the longest unique shortest path.

This project determines the graphs up to (and including) 10 vertices which are minor-minimal with respect to the minor floor of the spectator number.
